# Final Project App Studio (iOS)
Final project minor Programmeren UvA

## Problem Statement
Students often live with multiple roommates. Keeping things clean can be quite hard, especially when using paper and pen to draw out an to-do scheme for everyone, which in turn gets lost. 


## solution
A simple application, named 'RoomMates' (or in Dutch: 'Huisgenoten') could make it easy to create a to-do list for everyone in the house, all customized. Students could benefit from an easy-to-create scheme which can notify them when something has to be done. The scheme could entail some kind of points system, in which points can be rewarded or deducted. 

In addition, I'd like to add a simple 'dash' system for beer. (something like WieBetaaltWat, but not with money). Eventually, the app could grow to some kind of social media platform for your house to store e.g. photos and create shopping lists. It could even be possible to connect to neighbours to improve contact and fix bad relationships.

## Prerequisites

### Data Sources
* Data file which contains user accounts and information
* Data file which contains information for a house 

### External Components
* SQL data structure

### Similar Applications
* There are many TO DO applications, like Wunderlist, Evernote, etc...
* WieBetaaltWat is often used to divide students expenses

### Hardest Challenges
* I don't know if it's hard to create an application where multiple users can login and share information between accounts. To begin with, I think it's already a challenge to get users to log in and to be able to see their own profile page and user information.
* The code behind making a cleaning schedule or setting up a beer system is for later.
* In the end, this app should be easier to use then drawing a cleaning schedule with pen and paper and pin it up on the refrigerator.

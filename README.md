# Final Project App Studio (iOS)
Final project minor Programmeren UvA

## Problem Statement
Students often live with multiple roommates. Keeping things clean can be quite hard, especially when using paper and pen to draw out an to-do scheme for everyone, which in turn gets lost. 


## solution
A simple application, named 'RoomMates' (or in Dutch: 'Huisgenoten') could make it easy to create a to-do list for everyone in the house, all customized. Students could benefit from an easy-to-create scheme which can notify them when something has to be done. The scheme could entail some kind of points system, in which points can be rewarded or deducted. 

In addition, I'd like to add a simple 'dash' system for beer. (something like WieBetaaltWat, but not with money). Eventually, the app could grow to some kind of social media platform for your house to store e.g. photos and create shopping lists. It could even be possible to connect to neighbours to improve contact and fix bad relationships.
